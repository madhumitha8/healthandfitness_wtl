      <h3>Why Mudras?</h3>
      <p>Mudras act to stimulate different parts of the body involved with breathing and to affect the flow of energy in the body and even one's mood. The specific hand gestures and positions act as “locks” to guide energy flows and reflexes to the brain.<br>

      <h3>How to do</h3>
      <p>
The most well-known mudras are simple to do and are those performed while meditating in lotus position.  Start each Mudra session by "washing" your hands (rub your hands against each other about 10 times, hold hands before your Navel Chakra) this will help energy to flow in your hands.
