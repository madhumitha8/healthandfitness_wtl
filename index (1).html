			<h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
			<p>Eating healthy isn’t always easy, but committing to a healthy diet can be one of the smartest decisions you ever make. Why? Not only can eating well make you look and feel better, it can also save you money on future health costs.
 <abbr title="Document Object Model">
But even if you intend to “eat healthy,” knowing exactly what that means can be challenging. “Following a healthy diet includes choosing plenty of lean meats, eggs, vegetables, fruit, whole grain and dairy products,” says Debra Nessel, a registered dietitian with Torrance Memorial Medical Center in Torrance, California.
</p>
			<p>
Eating well also means leaving out or only rarely consuming foods that are high in added sugar, saturated fat and sodium. That includes most fast food, full-calorie sodas, processed snacks like chips and crackers, and anything with more milligrams of sodium than there are calories in a serving</p>

			<h3>So What is This About?</h3>

			<h3>How to stay focused on Healthy Eating?</h3>
			<p>Although it may seem like a silly practice to some, writing down your dietary intake can be extremely helpful. Writing down everything you eat and drink can provide accountability without bringing other individuals into the picture. Food intake can be documented either before or after consumption, although if you do it before you eat, it may help curb overeating. There are several electronic methods for recording food intake that can also be used if traditional journaling isn't your style.</p>
			<p>Planning ahead is key when sticking to a healthy eating plan. People mainly lose their focus because of their lack of planning, which can make them feel overwhelmed. By setting aside time each day to plan meals and snacks for the next day, you can prevent this. A weekly menu board is an effective tool for meal planning. Plotting nightly dinners in advance can make planning healthy meals easier and improve time management. Prepping snacks and lunches ahead of time can also help you stay focused and prevent you from eating unhealthy foods on impulse.</p>
			<p>Goal setting can be extremely beneficial when trying to stay focused. Goals will help increase self-motivation and decrease the likelihood of eating unhealthy. The most important thing to remember when setting goals is that the goal has to mean something significant to the individual. Personal attachment to a goal will increase the likelihood she stays on track. Goals should also be small, attainable and realistic. This will help prevent burnout and frustration. Once goals are reached, new goals should be set to further success.</p>

			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<p>Eating right and exercising regularly can help you avoid excess weight gain and maintain a healthy weight. According to the Mayo Clinic, being physically active is essential to reaching your weight-loss goals. <br><br><br>Doing right by your body pays off for your mind as well. The Mayo Clinic notes that physical activity stimulates the production of endorphins. Endorphins are brain chemicals that leave you feeling happier and more relaxed. </p>

		<div class="requirements" id="zen-requirements" role="article">
			<h3>Requirements</h3>
			<p>A person's support system can have a huge impact on their ability to stick to a healthy lifestyle change. Informing family, friends and co-workers about your healthy eating plan and asking them to encourage and support you can help you get through any difficult or frustrating moments. This can also provide accountability since most meals are eaten in the presence of others.Nutrition knowledge is important, but it is only one piece of the puzzle. The real secret is understanding your behaviors and motivations at their roots, and using this information to have a meaningful impact on your health. In this sense, good health starts in your brain, not on your plate.


The first thing you need to understand is that we don’t have as much control over our food decisions as most of us assume. We tend to believe that we can call on willpower anytime we wish and use it to order a salad instead of a burger, and if we fail to do so it is our own fault. However, self-control is not something we can simply turn on or off, and as a result the process of decision making––particularly when it comes to food––is much more complex.</p>
